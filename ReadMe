Ya the game isnt done, I was trying to use the classes that I already had and deal with the 
cards in each players hand but i quickly realised I needed to implement an 
aaray list for that and that I still needed to finish the game after that
I just kinda gave up and am instead going to study for my exams because I have a 68 in physics right 
now and I need a  70 to go to university. (I skipped a test and got a 0 on a WHOLE UNIT 
and my mark went down a whole bunch).
